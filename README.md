### **Project Proposal: Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Solving Partial Differential Equations**

---

### **Project Title:**  
**High-Performance Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Partial Differential Equation Solvers Using OpenMP and MPI**

---

### **Project Overview:**  
This project aims to implement a high-performance solver for partial differential equations (PDEs) using **Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)**. The solver will dynamically refine the computational grid in regions of interest (e.g., near steep gradients or singularities), improving accuracy while minimizing computational costs. The project will leverage **MPI** for distributed memory parallelism and **OpenMP** for shared memory parallelism to achieve scalability and efficiency.

The implementation will focus on solving a 2D PDE, such as the **heat equation** or a **wave equation**, with the AMR algorithm dynamically adjusting the grid resolution based on the solution's behavior.

### **Objectives:**
1. **Develop a 2D Finite Difference Solver:** Implement a basic finite difference method for solving a PDE (e.g., heat equation or wave equation).
2. **Incorporate Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR):** Add AMR capabilities to refine/coarsen the grid dynamically based on error estimators.
3. **Parallelize Using MPI and OpenMP:**  
   - Use **MPI** for domain decomposition across processes.  
   - Employ **OpenMP** for parallel computations within each subdomain.  
4. **Analyze Scalability:** Evaluate the solver’s performance in terms of speedup, memory usage, and scalability across multiple processes.
5. **Visualize Results:** Create clear visualizations of the adaptive grid and the PDE solution to demonstrate the effectiveness of the AMR technique.

### **Methodology:**

#### **Step 1: Basic PDE Solver**
- Implement a 2D finite difference method for a simple PDE:
  - **Heat Equation:** \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u\).
  - Discretize the equation using explicit or implicit schemes.
- Validate the solver with uniform grid resolutions.

#### **Step 2: Adaptive Mesh Refinement**
- Add AMR capabilities to dynamically refine and coarsen the grid based on:
  - Error estimators, such as differences in gradients or solution values.
  - Threshold criteria to trigger refinement or coarsening.
- Use a **quadtree data structure** to manage the adaptive grid.

#### **Step 3: Parallelization**
1. **MPI (Distributed Memory):**
   - Decompose the computational domain into subdomains, each handled by a different MPI process.
   - Implement communication between processes to synchronize the refined grid and boundary conditions.
2. **OpenMP (Shared Memory):**
   - Parallelize computations within each subdomain, such as finite difference operations and refinement/coarsening decisions.

#### **Step 4: Scalability and Testing**
- Test the solver on various grid sizes and number of processes/threads.
- Measure performance metrics:
  - **Speedup:** Runtime improvement as the number of processes/threads increases.
  - **Load Balancing:** Efficiency of the load distribution across processes during AMR.

#### **Step 5: Visualization**
- Generate visualizations of:
  - The adaptive grid at different time steps.
  - The evolution of the solution over time.
- Use libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Paraview**, or **VTK** for visualization.
